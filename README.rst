Minimal interferring Interactive Risk-aware Planning for multimodal and time-evolving obstacle behaviour

## Description
Planning safe human-robot interaction is a necessary towards the widespread integration of autonomous systems in the 
society. However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the 
stochasticity in peopleâ€™s behaviors. Previous approaches have either strongly simplified the multimodal and time-varying
behaviour of humans, applied hardly tractable methods lacking safety guarantees or were simply not computationally 
feasible. Therefore the goal of this work to develop a risk-aware planning methodology with special regards on 
minimizing the interaction between human and robot and taking account the actual multi-modality and time-evolving nature
of the humans behaviour, based on the Trajectron model (Ivanovic 19).  

Installation
------------
For installation clone the repository including it's submodules: 

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/simon-schaefer/mantrap.git

Next create a virtual environment for Python 3 and install all package requirements by running 

.. code-block:: bash

   source ops/setup.bash

Afterwards install the NLP-solver `IPOPT <https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/>`_ and it's python wrapper which is called
`cyipopt <https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Download
   # Install Ipopt NLP solver.
   cd external/Ipopt
   chmod u+x coinbrew
   brew install bash  # update bash version (>= 4.0)

   mkdir build
   ./coinbrew fetch Ipopt
   ./coinbrew build Ipopt --prefix=/path/to/build --test
   ./coinbrew install Ipopt

   # Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to IPOPT build directory
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="path/to/mantrap/external/IPOPT/build/Ipopt/master"
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/path/to/mantrap/mantrap/external/IPOPT/build/ThirdParty/Mumps/2.0"
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/path/to/mantrap/mantrap/external/IPOPT/build/ThirdParty/Metis/2.0"

   # Install cyipopt following https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/
   # Download binary files from https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/#files
   # Then install by running
   cd external/cyipopt
   python setup.py install


In order to ensure a working Trajectron model the branch :code:`online_with_torch` has to be checkout.

Evaluation
----------
The evaluation of mantrap is grounded on real-world pedestrian behaviour datasets. While the  
`ETH Pedestrian datasets <https://icu.ee.ethz.ch/research/datsets.html>`_ and some custom scenarios already have
been integrated, other datasets can be easily added using the mantrap_evaluation dataset API; for more information
regarding this please read :code:`mantrap_evaluation/datasets/README`.

Documentation
-------------
For code documentation the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ engine has been used. For building the
documentation locally setup the project and run :code:`make html` in the documentation folder. Then open the
documentation by opening the :code:`index.html` file in the resulting documentation build directory.

Running in optimized mode
-------------------------
Running python in optimized mode let's skip all :code:`assert` statements and sets the logging level to warning
in order to save runtime.

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -O evaluation.py
