Minimal interferring Interactive Risk-aware Planning for multimodal and 
time-evolving obstacle behaviour

## Description
Planning safe human-robot interaction is a necessary towards the widespread 
integration of autonomous systems in the society. However, while instinctive 
to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due 
to the stochasticity in peopleâ€™s behaviors. Previous approaches have either 
strongly simplified the multimodal and time-varying behaviour of humans, 
applied hardly tractable methods lacking safety guarantees or were simply not 
computationally feasible. Therefore the goal of this work to develop a 
risk-aware planning methodology with special regards on minimizing the 
interaction between human and robot and taking account the actual multi-modality
and time-evolving nature of the humans behaviour, based on the Trajectron 
model (Ivanovic 19).  


## Comments
* optimization over future points 
    * determine path candidates, perturb them using interaction grad and 
      pick the path with minimal cost (e.g. interaction force caused by ego, 
      control cost using acceleration amount) 
    * create graph structure over multiple time-steps by concatenating graphs
* evaluation interface
    * probabilistic: likelihood of perturbed trajectory over initial 
      distribution
    * deterministic: L2 distance of trajectory points
* tube based on distribution of gradients for probabilistic agent
* homotopy class --> given my base path, more globally optimal ??
* sphinx documentation 

* idea -> multi-modality ? every mode is an independent (weighted) ado
* idea -> minimal interfering, why ? natural way of walking in crowded areas
(local minima, "without a lot of considerations"), intrinsically a safe way 
of interaction and taking the "full" knowledge of the model into account (not 
just the output)
* model-based approach 
* idea -> gradient, why ? notion of direction and magnitude of violation, a lot 
of behavioral prediction models are graph-based (e.g. neural network) or can be
formulated as a graph (as social forces)
 
* baseline: least force caused by ego over the full trajectory -> interaction
minimal (e.g. in comparison with minimizing travel-time, ...)
* baseline: in the same scene let human in one and robot in another experiment
take decisions, let humans guess who is who based on trajectories 
-> "natural" way of interacting with other agents, specifically pedestrians
* baseline: ORCA (don't share responsibility in eq. (6) but full velocity 
adaption by ego --> interaction-minimization)

* GMM as n independent single Gaussians --> integration using Kalman Filter 
equations with state (x, v) and no input (s. Tim)
