Minimal interferring Interactive Risk-aware Planning for multimodal and time-evolving obstacle behaviour

## Description
Planning safe human-robot interaction is a necessary towards the widespread integration of autonomous systems in the 
society. However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the 
stochasticity in peopleâ€™s behaviors. Previous approaches have either strongly simplified the multimodal and time-varying
behaviour of humans, applied hardly tractable methods lacking safety guarantees or were simply not computationally 
feasible. Therefore the goal of this work to develop a risk-aware planning methodology with special regards on 
minimizing the interaction between human and robot and taking account the actual multi-modality and time-evolving nature
of the humans behaviour, based on the Trajectron model (Ivanovic 19).
