Minimal interferring Interactive Risk-aware Planning for multimodal and time-evolving obstacle behaviour

## Description
Planning safe human-robot interaction is a necessary towards the widespread integration of autonomous systems in the 
society. However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the 
stochasticity in peopleâ€™s behaviors. Previous approaches have either strongly simplified the multimodal and time-varying
behaviour of humans, applied hardly tractable methods lacking safety guarantees or were simply not computationally 
feasible. Therefore the goal of this work to develop a risk-aware planning methodology with special regards on 
minimizing the interaction between human and robot and taking account the actual multi-modality and time-evolving nature
of the humans behaviour, based on the Trajectron model (Ivanovic 19).  

## Installation
For installation clone the repository including it's submodules: 

```
git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/simon-schaefer/mantrap.git
```

Next create a virtual environment for Python 3 and install all package requirements by running 

```
source ops/setup.bash
```

Afterwards install the NLP-solver [IPOPT](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/) and it's python wrapper which is called 
[cyipopt](https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/):

```
# Download 
# Install Ipopt NLP solver. 
cd external/Ipopt
chmod u+x coinbrew
brew install bash  # update bash version (>= 4.0)

mkdir build
./coinbrew fetch Ipopt
./coinbrew build Ipopt --prefix=/path/to/build --test
./coinbrew install Ipopt

# Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to IPOPT build directory
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="path/to/mantrap/external/IPOPT/build/Ipopt/master"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/path/to/mantrap/mantrap/external/IPOPT/build/ThirdParty/Mumps/2.0"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/path/to/mantrap/mantrap/external/IPOPT/build/ThirdParty/Metis/2.0"

# Install cyipopt following https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/
# Download binary files from https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/#files
# Then install by running 
cd external/cyipopt
python setup.py install
```

In order to ensure a working Trajectron model the branch `online_with_torch` has to be checkout.

## Documentation 
For code documentation the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) engine has been used. For building the 
documentation locally setup the project and run `make html` in the documentation folder. Then open the documentation 
by opening the `index.html` file in the resulting documentation build directory. 

## Running in optimized mode
Running python in optimized mode let's skip all `assert` statements in order to save runtime.

```
python3 -O evaluation.py
```
