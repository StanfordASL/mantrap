## Handling risk cavities (multimodality, non-markovian)
- brute-force: tree-search over possible trajectories, mapping to reward function and deciding for the trajectory with largest reward ([1]), paralleled on GPU --> using Hindsight Optimisations instead for more efficient search ([2])

- Mode reduction and modelling: summarise modes to bundles which are modelled by Gaussian Process Models (e.g. "cones"), take the n most probable modes (weighted by the probabilities z_i in the VAE's latent space creating mode_i in bundles
--> optimisation cost formulation: 
J = J0 + sum_i^modes gamma_i border_function(mode_constraint) 
with J0 containing the robots traveling cost, final cost, etc. 
--> one set of parameters over all times, but quite computationally expensive
 
- Approximate the different ppdfs (positional pdf) in each mode and time-step by 2D Gaussian by sampling N trajectories for each mode and infer Gaussian distribution from it (or one 3D-xyt-Gaussian over time --> assumes smoothness over time ??)
--> GMM2D at every time step but weight does not change (unrealistic, since once a path/mode has been chosen it is usually way more likely to be continued !)   

- Changing Trajectron model to output GMM at every time-step or change "sampling" to choose most likely mode (removing randomness)

- Grid propagation: pyramidal grid prediction i.e. start with high-resoluted GMM grid at t=1, then insert every grid point as next point in trajectron model (like as being sampled from GMM) to build up t=2 grid, repeat until t=N with decreasing resolution (uncertainty in time increases anyway)
--> "smart" grid: only use grid points with P(x) > eps

- Kalman Filter propagation of initial gaussian distribution (single-integrator model)
--> very computational efficient
--> neglects any form of non-linear spatiotemporal evolvement 

## Optimization Constraint Formulation (Gaussian over time (nested Gaussians) is not a standard distribution (model non-linear, non-markovian, ...), however for efficient optimisation an analytic description of the ppdf at every point in time would be preferable)
- re-interpolate ppdf while enforcing smoothness constraints for analytic constraint

- Gaussian smoothing of tpdf grid for smoothing, as having polymodal GMM -> therefore analytic formulation (!local minima)

- Polytopic level set: find analytic formulation for eps-probability level set in grid (in simplest case just linear inequality constraints e.g. x_5 < [4.0, 1.3])

--> PROBLEM: Multiplication introduces non-convexity (bilinear) therefore using Gaussian directly is not feasible !!

## Simluation
- Obstacle disturbance in position or velocity space (more realistic in velocity, trajectron in velocity, but planner requires position), so how to transform some distribution from velocity in position space for any (not analytically known, since nested GMMs) distribution efficiently (not just particles) ? 
--> integrating velocity sequences (particles) directly and build distribution from the obtained positions. Another possibility would be to interpolate the pdf in the velocity space, obtain an analytic formulation and integrate it analytically. However we assume smoothness by interpolation in the velocity space, which probably is a larger assumption than the effect of integration error. 

## Baseline
- static pdf for every pedestrian
- deterministic Kalman prediction model for every pedestrian dependent on simple integrator model / social forces / ....

## Evaluation metrics
- empirical probability of failure in Monte-Carlo simulations (i.e. use derived policy and simulate 10000 runs while sampling from distributions, comp. [3])

# Trajectron
- query time with n pedestrians ==> ~Â 20 ms
- roughly average or maximum number of modes per pedestrian ==> max 16
- how do we get discrete trajectories for every mode, when sampling after every time-step (not like a branching tree) ? ==> iteratively sampling n trajectories sequences by re-applying the model

# Questions
- Baseline ? (Probabilistic graph search, just like Astar with time-dependent weights existing ?)
- how to handle inter obstacle dependence (like if obs_1 goes to position A, obs_2 might go to another position than if obs_1 would have gone to position B) ??
