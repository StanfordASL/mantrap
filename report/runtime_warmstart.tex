\subsection{Warm Starting}
\label{text:approach/runtime/warm_starting}
It is widely known that warm starting an optimization can be very beneficial for its convergence speed for several optimization algorithms, e.g. shown in \cite{Banerjee2020} for \ac{GuSTO} or for \ac{IPOPT} in \cite{Shahzad2010}, \cite{John2008} or \cite{Spielberge2019}.

Within project \project, the algorithm has been warm-started by solving the optimization problem posed in problem \ref{problem:general} while ignoring all objectives and constraints that relate to pedestrians, i.e., by solving the following optimization problem: \\

\begin{problem}{Simplified optimization problem for warm-starting}
\begin{align}
\min_{\u_{0:T-1}} \quad & J_{goal}(\x_{0:T}) \\
\textrm{s.t. } \quad & \x_{t+1} = \f(\x_t, \u_t) & \forall t \in [0, T - 1] \\
& \x \in \xset & \forall t \in [0, T]\\
& \u_t \in \uset & \forall t \in [0, T]\\
& \x_0 \in \xset_0
\end{align}
\label{problem:general_warm_starting}
\end{problem}

Since the simplified optimization problem in problem \ref{problem:general_warm_starting} does not depend on the pedestrian dynamics model $\tilde{\Phi}$, it is easier and more efficient to solve, being a convex quadratic program.
