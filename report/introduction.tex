\label{text:introduction}
Autonomous systems play an increasingly fundamental role in our society. A study by McKinsey in 2017 showed the effects of what increased automation will have on the economy. One of the keys inside of the study is that even as automation causes declines in some occupations, it will change many more, with an estimated 60 percent of occupations, of which at least 30 percent of constituent work activities will be automated.\footnote{\href{https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured\%20Insights/Future\%20of\%20Organizations/What\%20the\%20future\%20of\%20work\%20will\%20mean\%20for\%20jobs\%20skills\%20and\%20wages/MGI-Jobs-Lost-Jobs-Gained-Report-December-6-2017.ashx}{Jobs lost, Jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automation - McKinsey Global International}} The International Federation of Robotics, an association of unilateral robotics societies and companies operating in the field, illustrated the rise of service robots in many fields, such as logistics, healthcare or agriculture, in its annual report 2019.\footnote{\href{https://ifr.org/downloads/press2018/IFR\%20World\%20Robotics\%20Presentation\%20-\%2018\%20Sept\%202019.pdf}{Annual Report 2019 - IFR}} In addition to fully autonomous robots, there the IFR also states that there is an increasing share of collaborative robots, e.g., assisting object retrieval in warehouses or cleaning in hospitals.

A blog article published by the Management Review of MIT's Sloan School stated that this development might be vastly accelerated due to the societal effects of COVID-19.\footnote{\href{https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ai-robots-and-ethics-in-the-age-of-covid-19/}{AI, Robots, and Ethics in the Age of COVID-19 - MIT Sloan Management Review}} A perfect example of this development can be observed in the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in Singapore. A robot dog, "Spot", is patrolling to monitor social distancing measures. While in the example the robot still is piloted by a human controller, in the future these systems should work entirely autonomously.\footnote{\href{http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/meet-spot-the-safe-distancing-robot-on-trial-in-bishan-amk-park}{Meet Spot, the safe distancing robot on trial in Bishan-AMK Park - The Straits Times}}

Summarising, robots taking part in a growing part of our social and economic life, however, efficient but more importantly safe interaction between robots and humans is crucial for its success, interactions such as walking in between them as in the example displaying in Figure \ref{img:spot_in_park}.
\newline
In interactive multi-agent scenarios, the standard control loop of perceiving the sensor input, predicting, planning, and executing the action \cite{Siegwart2011} is extended by a backward loop, due to the effects of the planned actions which have to be taken into account. Therefore after planning some future trajectory of the robot, a simulation predicts the behavior of the interacting agents, conditioned on the planned robot trajectory (comp. Figure \ref{fig:control_loop_interactive}, the idea from \cite{Romanski2019}). To guarantee interaction properties such as safety, the planner usually has to take into account the other agents' behavior. However, as the term interactive implies, this behavior depends on the planned robot trajectory. This intrinsic dependence loop is subtle and hard to approximate social norms in human interaction and a priori unknown intentions of the humans make it especially hard to deal with the interactive scenario.

While humans use their "theory of mind" for reasoning about the other human's actions \cite{Gweon2013}, robots do not have this capacity (so far). Consequently, approaches that act in this highly dynamic, uncertain, and multi-modal environment try to reduce the complexity of the problem by making strong assumptions about human behavior and/or avoiding any risk. These approaches lack at least one of these properties crucial for working reliably and safely near humans: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Realistic representation of the real, complex human behavior including its multi-modal, probabilistic and highly dynamic nature
\item Guarantees on the prediction outcome which can be used to certify the safety of the system
\item Computational efficient for real-time application
\end{itemize}

When walking in crowded areas, humans use their theory of mind, giving them the capability to infer the actions of oncoming agents \cite{Ivanovic2018} \cite{Gweon2013}. To navigate through the crowd while avoiding the others as best as possible, then using the inferred information, humans leverage the inferred information and then steer towards a local minima regarding both the required travel time to reach some goal and to avoid the other pedestrian. In this way, as everyday life shows, the human way of naturally walking combines efficiency and safety. Although safety measures are not explicitly "optimized", collisions are prevented by reducing the amount of interaction, so that possibly un-safe scenarios are omitted before they can evolve instead of trying to contain safety within the interaction. In this work, we develop a robot planning algorithm for navigating in crowded, interactive scenarios. We leverage the notion that humans aim to minimize both the estimated travel time and the amount of interaction with others. The proposed robot planning algorithm depends on a "theory-of-mind" like model for prediction how agents may behave in the future.
