% todo: goals of the work
% todo: do not list papers !!!  a lot of different methods for planning in crowds different axes: interpretable optimisation, accurate behaviour prediction, but find general topics e.g. 
% 1. prediction of pedestrians (Trajectron, SF, ORCA, ...) 
% 2. control \& decision making (interaction-aware papers for example manipulation but multiple agents,  explainability, certifiability, ...)
% 3. types of trajectory optimisation (shooting, collocation, etc.)
% 4. safety (safety in interaction e.g. using reachability $\rightarrow$ Mathias althoff); what is good and bad about them ?
