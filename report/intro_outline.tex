\section{Outline of Work}
\label{text:introduction/outline}
This thesis contains five parts. Chapter \ref{text:introduction} motivates this work and provides insights into the challenges as well as possible applications, defines its goals, and gives a brief overview of the solution developed within the thesis. Chapter \ref{text:related} introduces the reader into related work in the areas of the pedestrian prediction model, controls \& decision-making algorithms focussing on the interaction between robots and humans, types of trajectory optimization algorithms and to technical notions of safety. Chapter \ref{text:approach} deep dives into the algorithm developed within this work, starting with a more detailed summary and continuing with a detailed description and explanation of each of its parts. Chapter \ref{text:experiments} validates the approach by presenting experimental results for different settings and scenarios, measuring its performance on baselines, and discussing the results. Finally, chapter \ref{text:conclusion} concludes the work and gives an outlook for future research directions.
