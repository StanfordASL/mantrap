\section{Goals}
\label{text:introduction/goals}
The goals of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
\item To design an interaction-aware planner: the robot needs to account for the responses of other agents and select plans that interferes least with others. This is important for settings where disruptions can lead to a lot of harm, such as robots operating in a hospitals, or in the example described beforehand of robots monitoring a park.
\item To provide safety assurance for the robot: the robot needs to acheive its goal safely and in a timely fashion. The prediction model may be inaccurate, or the planner does not properly account for rare yet catastrophic events. As such, there needs to be an additional layer of safety that ensures the robot remains safe regardless of the limitations of the model and/or planner.
\item To develop a real-time planning algorithm (~10Hz): in human-robot interactions, the interaction evolves rapidly and the robot needs to be able to replan sufficiently fast enough to react to rapid changes to the environment.
\end{itemize}
