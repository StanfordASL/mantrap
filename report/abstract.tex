With the rollout of robots in pedestrian-rich environments, the capability for robots to navigate among them safely, anticipative and efficiently becomes increasingly important. However, while intuitive to humans, socially-aware navigation still poses a difficult problem, mainly due to the stochastic and highly dynamic nature of human movement. Despite of the rise of the predictive capabilities of state-of-the-art, deep generative, multi-modal and probabilistic pedestrian prediction models, existing works mostly either use strong simplifying assumptions for human movement or non-interpretable methods for robot decision-making. This work combines the predictive power of deep learned prediction models and the certifiability of constrained trajectory optimization methods. Therefore, it proposes an optimization formulation to efficiently leverage generative models for trajectory optimization beyond their outputs, while guaranteeing a safe robot-human-interaction. The proposed algorithm is shown to enable anticipative, safe, but not overly conservative movements among many pedestrians.
