\chapter{Multi-Modal Interaction-Aware Trajectory Optimization}
\label{text:approach}

To the best of the author's knowledge, exploiting the gradient of a deep neural network for trajectory optimization has not been done before, likely due to the tight runtime requirements of an online optimization as well as the lack of guarantees and insights that can be retrieved from such an approach without further ado. Several approaches have dealt with data-driven prediction models outputs before. Accessing the model's internal structure enables computing gradients that are more informed about the actual interactions happening in a multi-agent scene beyond the trajectory predictions. However, computing a gradient by backward passing through the whole network is widely associated with sizeable computational effort. While this may be true in general, trajectory optimization networks and input data are comparably small enough to perform these computations efficiently.

Figure \ref{img:training_runtime} gives an inside into the runtime distribution of the Trajectron model, during training. Here, merely roughly one-fifth of the overall runtime is spent performing the backward pass, while most time is spent evaluating the loss function. In particular, forward- and backward-pass do not differ much regarding their overall runtime. While this is only one out of many examples, it illustrates the capability of performing a backward pass online.

In this chapter, an overview of the approach is provided. In Section \ref{text:approach/formulation}, the problem of socially aware motion planning is formulated formally, including the assumptions made within this project. 
\newline
Section \ref{text:approach/overview} presents an overview of the full trajectory optimization pipeline. It is shown how the algorithm is built to allow us to deal with general graph-like pedestrian behavior prediction models, with multimodal  probabilistic outputs. Furthermore, the advantages of formulating socially aware motion planning as an optimization problem while utilizing a graph-based prediction model, e.g., deep learning-based models such as the Trajectron \cite{Ivanovic2018}, over purely learned \cite{Chen2017} or purely optimization-based \cite{vandenBerg2011} algorithms are illustrated. Finally, it is explained how the usage of a general-purpose, computation-graph-based framework such as PyTorch \cite{pytorch} or TensorFlow \cite{tensorflow} can be harnessed for a highly modular, efficient, and versatile implementation.
\newline
The optimization problem's exact formulation is further explained in Section \ref{text:approach/objective} and \ref{text:approach/constraint}. Both the goal-driven and the interaction-driven parts are illustrated, beginning with the objective function and continuing with a derivation of their gradients. Furthermore, several designs of the specific objective function are discussed. The subsequent section addresses the design of the constraints used. Likewise, several constraint function designs are compared. 
\newline
To use the system in real-world applications, it must comply with several requirements. While the optimization design has tackled some of these, e.g., the feasibility of the robot's control limitations or safety regarding robot-human interaction, the system underlies runtime limits. Several runtime improvements have been implemented to achieve this goal, which are described in Section \ref{text:approach/runtime}.
