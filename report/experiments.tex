% Trajectron++: The few methods which do include such considerations are closed-source, tightly integrated with a specific robotic platform, or trained on private data [50,8,20,7].

% particle environments: Probabilistic Programming instead of particles for baselines ==> computationally expensive (Pyro), sampled-based (Jensn2007), see notebook probabilistic programming

% particle integration for gaussians => position to velocity for single integrator dynamics in general is Non-central chi-squared distribution (Non-central chi-squared distribution) however if we use the simplifying (approximate) assumptions that both the distribution of pos(t) and pos(t+1) are independent, then this simplifies to a gaussian normal distribution (https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDifferenceDistribution.html) ==> same mean anyway ... furthermore we use independence of directions x and y
