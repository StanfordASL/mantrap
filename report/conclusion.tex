%todo: Other applications: gradient-based trajectory optimization: not interaction but avoiding (maximise distance between ego trajectory and ado trajectories at every point of time)
%todo: future work => environment information (already included in Trajectron++,  so very straight-forward with additional constraint term) including static obstacles
%todo: ipopt other => Please keep in mind, that Ipopt is made for large scale optimization  problems. Problems that solve in less than a second were not the main  target when Ipopt had been implemented ... or SQP like Bonalli19
